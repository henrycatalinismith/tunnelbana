oops, this kind of turned into a whole redux toolkit

After a certain point my eyes get a little tired of reading those big hefty
middleware `switch (action.type)` statements. I lose track of what actually
runs, what it's there for, and in what order it all happens.

The idea with this is to fix both of those problems by:

* Splitting up the middleware `case` statements into individual functions so
 ¬†that they're not all sharing one big messy block scope with lots of unwanted
  `let` statements at the top.

* Expressing the timing of a middleware function (i.e. before or after the
  action that triggers it) directly, using `before()` and `after()` instead of
  having to do lots of strange custom metaprogramming to juggle the timming of
  the `next(action)` call.

Documentation
-------------

##### createMiddleware

Kinda seems like more examples are the way to document this thing since it's so simple.
So here's another one. There's also an [example.js](https://github.com/hnrysmth/signalbox/blob/master/example.js)
which is a working version of this that actually runs.

```javascript
const { createStore, applyMiddleware } = require("redux");
const { createMiddleware } = require("signalbox");

function counter(state = 0, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "INCREMENT":
      return state + 1;
    case "DECREMENT":
      return state - 1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

const middleware = createMiddleware((before, after) => ({
  [before("INCREMENT")](store) {
    console.log(`About to increment ${store.getState()}`);
  },
  [after("INCREMENT")](store) {
    console.log(`Just incremented to ${store.getState()}`);
  }
}));

const store = createStore(
  counter,
  undefined,
  applyMiddleware(...middleware)
);

store.dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT" });

```

```
About to increment 0
Just incremented to 1
```

##### createSelect

```javascript
const { createSelect } = require('bo-selecta');
exports.select = createSelect({
  users: {
    byId: (state, id) {
      return state[id];
    }
  }
});
```

##### stateAccessor

It assumes you're doing a very typical redux setup where the store is a plain
JS object and each selector only reads from its reducer's section of the overall
state. If the above don't apply, e.g. maybe you use Immutable.js, you can pass a
custom stateAccessor to get the correct `state` param to your selectors.

```javascript
const { createSelect } = require('bo-selecta');
const { * as userSelectors } = require('./reducers/users');
exports.select = createSelect({ users: userSelectors }, {
  stateAccessor(s, entity) {
    // Use the Immutable.js Map API to pass the correct subproperty of the store
    // to the selector functions
    return s.get(entity);
  }
});
```
